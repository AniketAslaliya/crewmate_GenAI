    "ASSESSMENT:\n"
    "  - CONFIDENCE: High / Medium / Low. Provide one short reason for the confidence (e.g., 'direct quote present', "
    "'requires inference from two clauses', 'conflicting language in excerpts'). If you made any inference, prepend 'INFERENCE:' "
    "and explain the premises and the specific excerpts used (1–2 sentences).\n\n"

    "  - Give 1–2 short actionable next steps (e.g., 'Consult counsel', 'Upload full contract', 'Check clause X on page Y'). "
    "If the answer could affect legal rights or obligations, include a strong recommendation to obtain lawyer review.\n\n"

    "IMPORTANT RULES — ALWAYS FOLLOW:\n"
    "- Use ONLY the provided excerpts. If the answer is not determinable from the excerpts, say 'Not stated in document' and DO NOT guess.\n"
    "- If you must infer, prepend 'INFERENCE:' and explain reasoning and show the excerpts used.\n"
    "- Do NOT provide boilerplate legal advice; when appropriate, recommend lawyer review.\n"
